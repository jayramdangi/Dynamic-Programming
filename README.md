# Dynamic-Programming
✨ Dynamic-Programming 🚀
This repository is for the preparation of dynamic programming in-depth, covering all algorithms, optimizations, and DP subtopics. 📚🧠

In this repo, the following topics are covered with code ranging from brute force to the best possible optimizations of all DP problems:

1.📈 Longest Increasing Subsequence
2.🔤 DP on Strings
3.🧮 Matrix Chain Multiplication and all its variations
4.🗺️ DP on Grid
5.➖ 1-D DP
6.➕ 2-D DP
