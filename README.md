# Dynamic-Programming
This repository is for the preparation of the dynamic programming in depth covering all algos, optimizations and dp subtopics.

 In this repo following topics are covered with code from brute force to the best possible optimization of all dp problems
 1. Longest Increasing Subsequence
 2. DP on Strings
 3. Matrix Chain Multiplication and all its variations
 4. DP on Grid
 5. 1-D DP
 6. 2-D DP
